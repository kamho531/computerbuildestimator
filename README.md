# Computer Build Estimator
Computer Build Estimator is an Android app developed in the platform of MIT App Inventor 2. The app is used to provide a cost estimate of building users' own desktop computer. Users can pick a preset budget level in which a combination of several computer components have been pre-determined or choose the custom level in which users can check their own combinations. After inputting with prices for other components, simply accept it and a breakdown of the total cost will be displayed on the first screen.
